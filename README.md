This repo uses leaflet to visualize earthquake data from the past 7 days.

The javascript calls data from [USGS GeoJSON Feed page](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) and generates a map of earthquake location, indicating the depth and magnitude using marker size and color.

The map renders similar to the image below:
